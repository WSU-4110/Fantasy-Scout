Sprint 1
(FR12 & FR7) Design Android app skeleton that outlined the site navigation and overall layout. The app featured a homepage (that was designed to show a little bit from each page)  with a bottom navigation bar that led to the home page, analyst page, settings page, and trending page. App also included a contact us button that launched an email application on the user’s phone with the Fantasy-Scout email as the recipient. While the site did get converted from a mobile app to a web app the design can still be seen in the current web app. 

Sprint 2
(FR27 & FR26) Converted the mobile app to a web app creating a similar style navigation system (but this time at the top instead of the bottom) and with the home page still showing a little bit from each page. Also added user login and register pages. 

Sprint 3
(FR3, FR5, FR8) Fleshed out trending page so that it shows the user which analyst has the best and worst grade/score. Added in bookmarking features so a user can toggle which analysts pop up on their homepage. Added in a small help section in the settings page to give the user a brief explanation and run through of the site. Fixed site navigation so that user actions (such as logging in or customizing profile) sends user to the proper place in the site instead of giving php notification (which was used for testing). Added in php sessions to properly connect logged in user and their actions into the database

Sprint 1
A Selenium based webdriver (created with java) indexes the fantasy alarm website and selects elements, iterating over sources and position while ensuring all games are accounted for. It then downloads the files as .CSV files, sending all of them to the downloads folder of my computer.

Sprint 2
A powershell script (created in powershell ise) uses the naming conventions provided by the website to move all the files from downlaods into a folder with user configured week number. Then, by order of download, we use the order of sources to retroactively sort by source and then positon. Folders are created, files are moved and renamed.

Sprint 3
A powershell script (created in powershell ise) uses the naming conventions I determined in sprint 2 and reads the csv files, selectively writing the necessary information into txt files formatted as our database manager Josh has created his algorithm around. It then matches the csv files with a txt file read from the source and position, omitting any positions that are redundant compilations of all positions into one (Ex. Flex)
