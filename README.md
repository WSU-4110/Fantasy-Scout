# Fantasy-Scout
* Fantasy Scout is a web application that compares mutliple fantasy football analysts predictions vs actual results and assigns each analyst a score and grade every week.

* Scoring is based on standard deviation between results and predictions. Grading is based on the relative score compared to the top and bottom analysts score.

* The bones of the website consists of automatic data collection (for both results and predictions) and an extensive database for storing data and calculating the weekly scores.

* The site has user friendly features including profile customization, analysts page, trending page (who is doing the best/worst), and following an analyst on top of a sleek UI.
